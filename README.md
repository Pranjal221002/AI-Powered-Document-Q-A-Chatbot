# AI-Powered-Document-Q-A-Chatbot
Tools: Python, Streamlit, LangChain, FAISS, OpenAI API, PDF/Text/DOCX Parsing

Developed an intelligent document Q&A system that allows users to upload multiple documents (PDF, TXT, DOCX) and interact with them using natural language queries. Utilized LangChain’s Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach with FAISS vector database for efficient semantic search. Integrated OpenAI’s GPT model to generate accurate answers based on document context. Built a user-friendly Streamlit UI with real-time response display, source tracing, and token/cost tracking. Designed the system to process and embed multiple files dynamically, enabling seamless multi-document understanding and scalable knowledge retrieval.
